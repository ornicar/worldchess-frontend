If you win two games consecutively you will start a double point streak, represented by a flame icon. The following games will continue to be worth double points until you fail to win a game. That is, a&nbsp;win will be worth 4 points, a draw 2 points, and a loss will still not award any points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, two wins followed by a draw will be worth 6 points: 2 + 2 + (2 x 1)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How is the winner decided?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The player(s) with the most points at the conclusion of the tournament&#39;s set time limit will be announced winner(s).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When two players have the same number of points, the tournament performance is the tie break.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How does the pairing work?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At the beginning of the tournament, players are paired based on their rating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As soon as you finish a game, return to the tournament lobby: you will then be paired with a&nbsp;player close to your ranking. This ensures minimum wait time, however you may not face all other players in the tournament.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Play fast and return to the lobby to play more games and win more points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How does it end?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The tournament has a countdown clock. When it reaches zero, the tournament rankings are frozen, and the winner is announced. Games in progress must be finished, however they don&#39;t count for the tournament.</p>",
